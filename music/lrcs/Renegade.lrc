[00:08.252]表演者: Substantial和X.ARI
[00:10.320]
[00:10.923]哈
[00:11.791]她是那种雇佣兵
[00:13.074]你不想干翻天覆地的大事就最好别去招惹她
[00:16.544]她可是那种为达到目的不择手段的狠角
[00:19.692]罔顾受害者，无视道德秩序，去造成意想不到的后果
[00:22.835]她从来面不改色地站在瘆人战火中央
[00:24.851]你绝想不到她于万千火海中完成任务的场景
[00:27.923]她在黑暗中绽放，为了将丢失的光明寻回
[00:30.969]她身上的悔过与罪孽，如藤蔓缠绕挣扎
[00:34.006]试着冲破雾霭吧，她可不是为无意义的战死而生的
[00:37.318]
[00:37.681]不需要深思熟虑
[00:38.735]一鼓作气是最好的选择
[00:40.413]你最好学着当个士兵
[00:42.079]乖乖听从我的命令
[00:43.358]
[00:43.785]享受这生活方式
[00:44.892]哪怕离经叛道
[00:46.652]我可要警告你
[00:48.253]这是出于怜悯的警告
[00:49.579]
[00:50.031]你唯一需要记住的事实就是
[00:52.901]我做事不择手段
[00:53.934]不顾后果
[00:55.943]将他们全部击破来主导战况
[00:58.494]我做事罔顾一切
[00:59.955]生死置外
[01:02.414]我让你以为自己依旧掌握着优势
[01:04.963]然后一转攻势地将你玩入股掌
[01:08.126]你要把这件事给牢牢烙进脑子
[01:10.964]那就是我做事不择手段
[01:12.437]无人能挡
[01:14.100]
[01:14.935]我是那个叛徒
[01:16.131]笑着捅你一刀的家伙
[01:20.393]
[01:20.983]我可不是个好女孩
[01:22.011]我马上就要牵动引线
[01:23.883]也许你在想办法应对
[01:25.381]但你整支队伍都在我布下的陷阱中央
[01:26.878]
[01:27.195]这里没有哪个渣滓能与我抗衡
[01:30.121]你认为自己掌握的人质优势不过是我提供的诱饵
[01:33.168]
[01:33.495]我可很清楚下一步应该做些什么
[01:34.714]脚踩百骸，只为让我走向巅峰
[01:36.303]引诱你上钩，我在玩操纵你命运的游戏
[01:38.440]打破僵局，你的死亡只是时间问题
[01:39.525]
[01:39.780]看看我的源石手榴弹多得几近疯狂
[01:40.979]我要把它们都引爆，火光和碎片才是我的风格
[01:42.492]生来就是领导者，我的萨卡兹小队无人可挡
[01:44.066]希望你是卧倒在地上吃灰时听到的我的声音
[01:45.677]
[01:46.169]不需要深思熟虑
[01:47.468]一鼓作气是最好的选择
[01:48.876]你最好做个优秀的士兵
[01:50.456]严格遵守我的命令
[01:51.755]
[01:52.128]享受这生活方式
[01:53.671]哪怕离经叛道
[01:55.213]我可要警告你
[01:56.822]这是近乎戏谑的警告
[01:58.027]
[01:58.509]你唯一需要记住的事实就是
[02:01.372]我做事不择手段
[02:02.321]不顾后果
[02:03.817]将他们全部击破来主导战况
[02:06.867]我做事罔顾一切
[02:08.450]生死置外
[02:10.261]我诱导你认为选择权在你手上
[02:13.468]但现在你会发现我们的角色已然颠倒
[02:16.624]你要把这件事给牢牢烙进脑子
[02:19.409]那就是我做事不择手段
[02:20.910]无人能挡
[02:22.679]
[02:24.517]呵，你们还不清楚自己交手的是何方神圣
[02:27.874]我来跟你们说明白
[02:29.025]
[02:29.630]在不同势力间来回辗转，她就像分饰两角的玩家，但她玩弄的是你
[02:32.824]想要玩弄她？那你真是不要命了，你没有赢的可能
[02:36.128]她的一切所作所为不过是在愉悦自己，可惜你在她说永别时才明白
[02:39.366]想试探她？你要做好和自己祷告的上帝来个见面会的准备
[02:42.756]所以站在让她认为你不是障碍威胁的地方，如果你想活在将被她改变的世界
[02:46.011]哪怕她声明站在正面，她也是那堆好人里的卑劣惯犯
[02:49.399]她可是个冷血动物，这致使她将为所想不论代价与苦痛
[02:52.435]这不过是游戏的一部分，为了兴致而参与的，你不乐在其中吗？
[02:55.909]
[02:57.898]你唯一需要记住的事实就是
[02:59.988]我做事不择手段
[03:01.396]不顾后果
[03:03.424]将他们全部击破来主导战况
[03:06.054]我做事罔顾一切
[03:07.659]生死置外
[03:09.307]我让你以为自己依旧掌握着优势
[03:12.635]然后一转攻势地将你玩入股掌
[03:15.804]你要把这件事给牢牢烙进脑子
[03:18.602]那就是我做事不择手段
[03:20.036]无人能挡
[03:21.750]
[03:22.710]你唯一需要记住的事实就是
[03:25.358]那就是我做事不择手段
[03:26.443]不顾后果
[03:28.705]将他们全部击破来主导战况
[03:30.985]我做事罔顾一切
[03:32.621]生死置外
[03:34.932]我会让你在数到三前有投降的权利
[03:37.636]然后笑着高声喊三让你们走投无路
[03:40.749]你要把这件事给牢牢烙进脑子
[03:43.461]那就是我做事不择手段
[03:45.054]无人能挡
[03:47.032]
